:Description: This is vision text for the Aristotle Library Apps project

The `Aristotle Library Apps`_ portfolios are HTML5 mobile, tablet, and PC single 
purpose apps that allow the user to discovery and access bibliographic and 
library information. Productivity apps are available to authenticated users 
for managing the bibliographic information and library operational data all
stored in Redis datastore instances.

These apps can be used in isolation, be developed independently from each 
other, and are released in an incremental fashion. Eventually, this 
collection of apps will supercede the need to have a traditional 
intregrated library system.
